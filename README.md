> **Transform Chaos into Intelligence. Build AI systems with context graphs, decision tracking, and advanced knowledge engineering that are explainable, traceable, and trustworthy — not black boxes.**

</div>

---

## The Problem

AI agents today are powerful but not trustworthy:

- ❌ **No memory structure** — agents store embeddings, not meaning. There's no way to ask *why* something was recalled.
- ❌ **No decision trail** — agents make decisions continuously but record nothing. When something breaks, there's no history to audit.
- ❌ **No provenance** — outputs can't be traced back to source facts. In regulated industries, this is a hard compliance blocker.
- ❌ **No reasoning transparency** — black-box answers with zero explanation of how a conclusion was reached.
- ❌ **No conflict detection** — contradictory facts silently coexist in vector stores, producing unpredictable outputs.

These aren't edge cases. They're the reason AI can't be deployed in healthcare, finance, legal, and government without custom guardrails built from scratch every time.

## The Solution

Semantica is the **context and intelligence layer** you add on top of your existing AI stack:

- ✅ **Context Graphs** — a structured, queryable graph of everything your agent knows, decides, and reasons about.
- ✅ **Decision Intelligence** — every decision is tracked as a first-class object with causal links, precedent search, and impact analysis.
- ✅ **Full Provenance** — every fact links back to its source. W3C PROV-O compliant. No more mystery answers.
- ✅ **Reasoning Engines** — forward chaining, Rete networks, deductive, abductive, and SPARQL. Explainable paths, not black boxes.
- ✅ **Quality & Deduplication** — conflict detection, entity resolution, and pipeline validation built in.

> Works alongside LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, and any LLM — Semantica is the **accountability layer** on top, not a replacement.

```bash
pip install semantica
```

## 🚀 What's New in v0.4.0

### 🕐 Temporal Intelligence Stack

Everything you need to reason about *when* — not just *what*.

- **Temporal GraphRAG** — retrieve knowledge as it existed at any point in the past. Natural-language queries like *"what did we know before the 2024 merger?"* are automatically parsed for temporal intent, with zero LLM calls.
- **Allen Interval Algebra** — 13 deterministic interval relations (before, meets, overlaps, during, starts, finishes, equals, and their converses). Find gaps, measure coverage, detect cycles — all without touching an LLM.
- **Point-in-time Query Engine** — reconstruct a self-consistent graph snapshot at any timestamp. Comes with a consistency validator that catches 5 classes of temporal errors: inverted intervals, dangling edges, overlapping relations, temporal gaps, and missing entities.
- **Temporal Metadata Extraction** — ask the LLM to annotate each extracted relation with `valid_from`, `valid_until`, and a calibrated confidence score (0–1 scale with baked-in anchors, so the model doesn't cluster near 1.0).
- **TemporalNormalizer** — converts ISO 8601, partial dates, relative phrases ("last year", "Q1 2024"), and 13 domain-specific phrase maps (Healthcare, Finance, Cybersecurity, Supply Chain, Energy…) into UTC datetime pairs. Zero LLM calls.
- **Bi-temporal Provenance** — every provenance record is automatically stamped with transaction time. Full revision history and audit log export in JSON or CSV. Temporal relationships export as OWL-Time RDF triples.
- **Decision validity windows** — decisions now carry `valid_from` / `valid_until`. Superseded decisions stay in the graph — history is immutable. Point-in-time causal chain reconstruction included.
- **Named checkpoints** — snapshot the full agent context at any moment and diff two snapshots to see exactly what changed.

→ [Temporal docs](docs/reference/) · [Temporal examples](cookbook/)

### 📚 SKOS Vocabulary Management

Build and query controlled vocabularies inside your knowledge graph

- Add SKOS concepts with labels, alt-labels, broader/narrower hierarchy, and definitions — all required triples assembled automatically.
- Query and search vocabularies with SPARQL-backed APIs (injection-sanitized).
- REST API for the Explorer: list schemes, fetch full hierarchy trees (cycle-safe), and import `.ttl` / `.rdf` / `.owl` files.

→ [SKOS docs](docs/reference/ontology.md)

### 🔷 SHACL Constraints

Turn ontologies into executable data contracts — no hand-authoring.

- Auto-derive SHACL node and property shapes from any Semantica ontology. Deterministic: same ontology always produces the same shapes.
- Three strictness tiers: `"basic"` (structure + cardinality), `"standard"` (+ enumerations and inheritance), `"strict"` (closes shapes — rejects undeclared properties).
- Validate any RDF graph and get back a report with plain-English violation explanations ready to feed into an LLM or pipeline.
- Use in CI to catch breaking ontology changes before they reach production.

→ SHACL shape generation and validation are available via the `OntologyEngine` — see [ontology docs](docs/reference/ontology.md)

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Fixes

- **ContextGraph pagination** — memory complexity dropped from O(N) to O(limit). A 50k-node graph no longer allocates 2.5M dicts per paginated request.
- **Named graph support** — full config-flag enforcement, duplicate clause prevention, backward-compat URI alias, and safe URI encoding in SPARQL pruning.
- **Ollama remote support** — `OllamaProvider` now correctly connects to remote Ollama servers instead of silently falling back to `localhost`.
- **Security** — API key logging removed from extractors; CI workflows locked to least-privilege `contents: read`.

→ [Full changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [Release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md)

- **Decision Intelligence** — complete lifecycle from recording to impact analysis; `PolicyEngine` with versioned rules.
- **KG Algorithms** — PageRank, betweenness centrality, Louvain community detection, Node2Vec embeddings, link prediction.
- **Deduplication v2** — blocking/hybrid candidate generation **63.6% faster**; semantic dedup **6.98x faster**.
- **Delta Processing** — SPARQL-based incremental diff, `delta_mode` pipelines, snapshot versioning.
- **Export** — Parquet (Spark/BigQuery/Databricks ready), ArangoDB AQL, RDF format aliases.
- **Pipeline** — exponential/fixed/linear backoff, `PipelineValidator`, fixed retry loop.

## ✨ What Semantica Does

### 🧩 Context & Decision Intelligence

Track every decision your agent makes as a structured, queryable graph node — with causal links, precedent search, impact analysis, and policy enforcement.

- Every decision records who made it, why, what outcome was chosen, and how confident.
- Decisions are linked causally so you can trace the full chain of reasoning that led to any outcome.
- Hybrid similarity search finds past decisions that match the current scenario.
- Policy rules validate decisions against business constraints before or after they're made.
- `AgentMemory` handles short/long-term storage and conversation history across sessions.

→ [Decision tracking docs](docs/reference/) · [Decision tracking example](cookbook/)

### 🕐 Temporal Reasoning

Ask not just *what* your agent knows, but *when it was true*.

- Reconstruct your knowledge graph at any point in the past without modifying the current graph.
- Parse natural-language temporal queries and rewrite them into structured datetime constraints.
- Reason over time intervals using a full deterministic Allen algebra implementation.
- Normalize any date expression — ISO 8601, relative phrases, domain-specific vocabulary — into UTC.
- Extract temporal validity from text using the LLM, with calibrated confidence scores.

→ [Temporal docs](docs/reference/) · [Temporal cookbook](cookbook/)

### 🗺️ Knowledge Graphs

Build, enrich, and analyze knowledge graphs with production-grade algorithms.

- Add entities, relationships, and typed properties with full metadata support.
- Run PageRank, betweenness centrality, and Louvain community detection out of the box.
- Generate Node2Vec embeddings and score potential new links.
- Delta processing keeps large graphs fresh without full recomputes.

→ [KG docs](docs/reference/)

### 🔍 Semantic Extraction

Pull structured knowledge out of raw text.

- Extract entities and relationships from text using LLMs or rule-based methods.
- Generate (subject, predicate, object) triplets ready to load into any KG.
- Deduplicate entities intelligently — Jaro-Winkler, semantic, and hybrid strategies. v2 is up to **6.98x faster**.
- Optionally have the LLM annotate each relation with temporal validity and confidence.

→ [Extraction docs](docs/reference/)

### 🧠 Reasoning Engines

Go beyond retrieval — derive new facts from what you know.

- **Forward chaining** — IF/THEN rules over facts.
- **Rete network** — high-throughput production rule matching for real-time event streams.
- **Deductive** — classical inference from axioms.
- **Abductive** — generate plausible hypotheses from observations.
- **SPARQL** — query-based inference over RDF graphs.
- **Temporal** — deterministic Allen algebra, no LLM required.

→ [Reasoning docs](docs/reference/)

### 📋 Provenance & Auditability

Every fact, decision, and computation links back to where it came from.

- Auto-stamp transaction time on every provenance record.
- Query full revision history for any fact — version, author, validity window, supersession chain.
- Export audit logs in JSON or CSV.
- Export temporal relationships as OWL-Time RDF triples.
- W3C PROV-O compliant across all modules.

→ [Provenance docs](docs/reference/)

### 🔷 Ontology & SHACL

Build, import, and enforce data contracts for your knowledge graphs.

- Auto-generate OWL ontologies from any KG — no hand-authoring.
- Import existing ontologies in OWL, RDF, Turtle, or JSON-LD.
- Derive SHACL shapes from any ontology and validate graphs against them.
- Manage SKOS controlled vocabularies with hierarchy, search, and REST APIs.

→ [Ontology docs](docs/reference/ontology.md)

### 🏭 Pipeline & Production

Orchestrate multi-stage KG pipelines with reliability built in.

- Chain ingest → extract → deduplicate → build → export stages with a fluent builder API.
- Validate the pipeline config before running it.
- Retry failed stages with exponential backoff, fixed delay, or linear backoff.
- 100+ LLM providers via LiteLLM — OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Ollama, Azure, Bedrock, and more.

→ [Pipeline docs](docs/reference/)

### 🔎 Vector Store

Semantic memory with hybrid search and metadata filtering.

- FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, PgVector, and in-memory — one API for all.
- Hybrid search mixes vector similarity and keyword matching with configurable weights.
- Filter by any metadata field, or tune similarity weights per use case.

# Derive an OWL ontology from any data dict
ontology = engine.from_data(your_data_dict)

# Export as OWL (Turtle or RDF/XML)
engine.export_owl(ontology, path="domain_ontology.owl", format="turtle")

# Validate ontology consistency
result = engine.validate(ontology)

# Generate ontology from raw text using an LLM
ontology = engine.from_text("Employees work at companies. Companies have departments.")

# Convert ontology to OWL string
owl_str = engine.to_owl(ontology, format="turtle")
```
